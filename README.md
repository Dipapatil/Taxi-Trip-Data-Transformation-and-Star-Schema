# Taxi Trip-Data-Transformation-and-Star-Schema
## Introduction
This project involves designing a Star Schema for analyzing taxi trip data efficiently. The data is processed through ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) steps, including data conversion, cleansing, and transformation to ensure consistency. The structured schema consists of a central fact table storing trip-related metrics and multiple dimension tables for locations, time, payment types, and rate codes. This transformation enables optimized querying, reporting, and business intelligence analysis. 

## Tools Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, Lucid Chart

## Packages Used
Pandas, pyarrow
